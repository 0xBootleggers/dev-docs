# DAOhaus Developer Docs

For Web3 developers aiming to bypass complex stack construction, DAOhaus V3 presents a suite of resources designed to let you focus on creating value for your community. With our [Software Development Kit](#), you can bootstrap DAO applications without spending months on backend setup.

Our DAO Toolbox simplifies reading and writing DAO data, regardless of whether you're developing a standalone project or extending the [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/) functionality. We've poured our years of experience into creating this solution, aimed at saving your time and helping you prioritize what truly matters.

Our contracts write directly to the blockchain, and the [subgraphs](#) streamline data querying. We've designed our utilities to tap into this base layer, fostering accessibility for applications built on top.

Our [SDK](#) packages have been published to NPM. We've made querying simpler with the [DAO Data](#) library, and have also included our component library in the [UI](#) package, along with some savvy builders for common features to expedite DAO app development.

We offer these tools as a contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem. The journey of crafting DAOs is challenging. We've spent years pondering, creating, failing, and iterating on processes and tools to master [Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). As a community, we aim to become stronger and invite you to participate in this project. Your feedback, bug reports, and feature requests will help improve this DAO Toolbox. Our software development kit, decentralized infrastructure, and documentation are all open-source, housed within the [`daohaus-monorepo`](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo/) and [`sdk-docs`](#) repositories on GitHub.

We also encourage you to join our ongoing conversation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/daohaus)!
