## The DAOhaus Stack

The architecture of DAOhaus is built upon a layered approach to ensure flexibility, scalability, and ease of use.

### [SDK](/sdk/starter)

At the heart of the DAOhaus framework is the SDK. Designed for rapid development, it enables users to swiftly create a DAO app using our starter repo. The starter, crafted with TypeScript in React, offers a plethora of functionality like DAO overview, proposal forms, and members list, all while leveraging the Vite development environment for front-end optimization. It's an all-in-one toolkit that embeds both single and multi-DAO capabilities, wallet connections, and more.

### [Subgraphs](/subgraphs)

These provide a structured way to fetch data using a well-defined schema. The DAOhaus subgraph schema comprises entities such as DAOs, Proposals, Votes, and Members, among others. This structured representation ensures data consistency and accessibility across DAOhaus applications.

### [Contracts](/contracts)

Powering the DAOhaus apps is the robust Moloch DAO framework, a testament to our commitment to combating Coordination Failure. Moloch v3, our latest version, amalgamates the best of Moloch, Minion, and Compound frameworks. It's more than just a DAO template; it's a minimalistic yet modular governance layer that interfaces seamlessly with the Gnosis Zodiac standards, ensuring fluid transactions over a multisig treasury.

Dive deeper into each layer, and you'll uncover the meticulous thought and expertise invested in every line of code and design decision. Welcome aboard!
