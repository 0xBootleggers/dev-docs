# Write a Shaman

Alright, first things first. Shamans are not just spiritual healers; in our context, they're special admin scripts designed for automating DAO features. If you're curious where to find them, you'd want to head on over to the [HausDAO](https://github.com/HausDAO) organization on Github.

## Permissions

Think of shamans as special roles within the DAO. There are several levels of permissions to be aware of:

- **Admin**: Has the mighty power to pause or unpause tokens.
- **Governor**: Is in charge of adjusting governance configurations and can even cancel proposals.
- **Manager**: Plays the role of minting and burning tokens.

## Repositories

First is the [baal-tokens](https://github.com/HausDAO/baal-tokens) repository. Think of this as your playground; it's primarily used for creating shamans and experimentation. If you're looking to set up a new DAO with multiple shamans, this repo will be especially helpful. It supports custom tokens using a factory pattern.

Next up, we have the [baal-shamans](https://github.com/HausDAO/baal-shamans) repository. This has a treasure trove of examples and is essentially the precursor to 'Baal Tokens'.

### Baal Tokens

Now, if you're feeling adventurous, go ahead and fork the 'Baal Tokens' repo to experiment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HausDAO/baal-tokens.git
```

While you're there, familiarize yourself with its layout and purpose. Here you'll find configurations for summoners, tokens, and shamans, and also get introduced to higher-order summoners or factories. We are using indexed factories for seamless SDK integration.

### Baal Shamans

Okay, it's time to get our hands a bit dirty. Fork and clone the 'Baal Shamans' repo locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HausDAO/baal-shamans.git
```

For initialization, we'll use `pnpm`, which operates similarly to `npm` or `yarn`. Check out the 'ETH Onboarder' ([EthOnboarder.sol](https://github.com/HausDAO/baal-shamans/blob/main/contracts/onboarder/EthOnboarder.sol)) shaman. Spend some time understanding it's functions, especially how it mints shares or loot.

Ready for customization? Start with the iBaal interface from the [@daohaus/baal-contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@daohaus/baal-contracts) NPM package. Feel free to integrate functionalities from OpenZeppelin, give your shaman a unique name for frontend and SDK recognition, and set those public variables for frontend and SDK interactions.

## Testing and Deployment

Now, before sending our creation into the wild, we must test it. Familiarize yourself with the test framework by importing it from the [@daohaus/baal-contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@daohaus/baal-contracts) NPM package. Dive deep into its behavior file, fixture file, and base test file.

Once ready, compile and run tests. But, a quick heads up, ensure your `.env` file is primed with your Infura key and mnemonic private key.

For deployment, there are available scripts to make your life easier. Also, consider the clone pattern -- it's a real game-changer when thinking about gas savings and initialization.

## Next Steps

And there you have it! From here, the world is your oyster. You can choose what to focus on next. Want to learn more about our tools?
