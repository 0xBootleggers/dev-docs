## Membership in DAOs

In the world of DAOs, a unique feature is having "Skin in the Game", which allows members to demonstrate their dedication and commitment to the DAO. This mechanism also serves as a deterrent against potential malicious actors. DAO membership is designed to be fluid and easy, with members having the freedom to exit at any time, unless they have a 'Yes' vote on an open proposal.

## Member List

Each column in the Members List can be sorted in ascending and descending order.
