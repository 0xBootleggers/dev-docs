# Settings

The Settings page presents a comprehensive view of your DAO metadata, contract details, and key settings.

## Metadata

Metadata provides basic information about the DAO, including:

![metadata](https://github.com/HausDAO/monorepo/assets/522182/6f7debf5-234f-4178-aaa0-95d8df54c6ea)

The `Update Settings` button allows DAO members to change this information without requiring a proposal.
