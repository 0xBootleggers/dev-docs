# Hub

The Hub serves as your command center within the app, providing comprehensive control and an overview of your DAO interactions. Here's what you can do in the Hub:

1. **View All DAO Memberships:** At a glance, see all the DAOs you're a part of.
2. **Navigate Quickly:** Jump easily between different DAOs.
3. **Stay Updated:** View badges for active proposals in your DAOs.
4. **Search DAOs:** Use keywords to find DAOs quickly and efficiently.
5. **Filter DAOs:** Filter DAOs by network or by delegation status (whether you are delegated to or have delegated your votes to others).
6. **Switch Views:** Toggle between list and card view based on your preference.
7. **Sort DAOs:** Arrange DAOs by proposals, members, chronological order (newest or oldest), enhancing your browsing experience.
