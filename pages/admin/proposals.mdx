# Proposals

Proposals are the backbone of decision-making within a DAO. They are employed to make various decisions such as adding or removing members, allocating Shares and Loot, distributing funds, and even for interacting with other applications and communities.

## Overview

The Proposals page provides an overview of all DAO proposals. Each proposal displays:

- Proposal number
- Type of proposal
- Submission date
- Title and details
- Member who submitted
- Current status
- Quorum (if applicable)
- Voting progress - both as a percentage and visually as a progress bar

Proposals can be sorted via search (using keywords), or filtered by status:

- Unsponsored
- In Voting
- In Grace
- Ready to Execute
- Passed
- Action Failed
- Defeated
- Expired

## Proposal Details

### Transaction Call Data

These are the details of the contract interactions that will take place when the proposal is executed.

### Stages

1. **Submit:** Anyone, including non-members, can submit proposals.
2. **Sponsor:** Proposals start in the Unsponsored section and must be sponsored to move to voting. While you can sponsor your own proposal, it's recommended to have another member do it to ensure accuracy.
3. **Queue:** Sponsored proposals enter the Queue before voting begins, ensuring a smooth transition of proposals to voting.
4. **Voting:** Members vote on the proposal during this period. A proposal needs more 'Yes' than 'No' votes to pass.
5. **Grace:** After voting, the proposal is set to pass or fail based on the votes. Members who voted 'No' can ragequit if they have no pending 'Yes' votes.
6. **Completed:** Successful proposals are marked as Completed and executed as specified. You can view all outcomes affecting you under 'View Member Profile' by clicking your Address.
