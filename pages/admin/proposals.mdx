# Proposals

Proposals are the backbone of decision-making within a DAO. They are employed to get sentiment about an issue, add or remove members, allocate voting and non-voting tokens, distribute funds, and even interact with other applications and communities.

## Overview

The Proposals page provides an overview of all DAO proposals. Each proposal displays:

- Proposal number
- Type of proposal
- Submission date
- Title and description
- Member who submitted
- Current status
- Quorum (if applicable)
- Voting progress - both as a percentage and visually as a progress bar

Proposals can be sorted via search (using keywords), or filtered by status:

- Unsponsored
- In Voting
- In Grace
- Ready to Execute
- Passed
- Action Failed
- Defeated
- Expired

Tapping the `View Details` button on a card take you to additional information about the proposal.

### Proposal Types

- **ERC-20 Token Transfer**: Request ERC-20 tokens from the DAO treasury.
- **Network Token Transfer**: Request network's native token from the DAO treasury.

#### Advanced

- **Use WalletConnect**: Interact with external contracts and applications.

##### Multicall Proposal Builder

This is a powerful feature allowing you to create custom proposals with contract interactions. Pasting a contract address and ABI into an Action gives you the ability to select specific Contract Functions. The actions are combined into a proposal that is excuted as a batch if the proposal passes.
