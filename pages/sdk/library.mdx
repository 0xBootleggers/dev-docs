The [DAOhaus UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@daohaus/ui) package is a comprehensive library, offering a robust set of UI components. You can import and use these to construct your application's user interface. The package caters particularly to TypeScript app development and can be adapted to any framework.

The component library is designed for rapid application development with limited customization, specifically targeting those building a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app with DAOhaus styles. It is composed with the following libraries:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors)

The library also includes a [Storybook](https://storybook.daohaus.fun/).

## Organization

![atoms-molecules-organisms](https://github.com/HausDAO/monorepo/assets/522182/0e7db751-c751-431d-b7b0-53f5193d4e35)

The components are organized into _Atoms_, _Molecules_, _Organisms_, and _Layouts_. This organization allows you to install the entire package or pick the components you need. Even though we bundle many elements together, we also provide the primitives when possible. If a molecule doesn't suit your needs, you can reconstruct it as you wish. For more detailed usage, refer to the associated [story](https://storybook.daohaus.fun/) for each component.
