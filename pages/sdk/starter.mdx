# DAO App Starter

Quickly build a DAO app with our starter repo and use [Admin](https://admin.daohaus.club/) app functionality unlocking endless customization options with DAOhaus tooling. We did the hard work of coding the proposals and transactions allowing you to focus on practical use cases.

The starter is written with TypeScript in React and uses the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) development environment for front-end tooling.
