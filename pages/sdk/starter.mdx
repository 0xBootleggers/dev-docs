# DAO App Starter

Quickly build a DAO app with our starter repo and use Admin app functionality unlocking endless customization options with DAOhaus tooling. We did the hard work of coding the proposals and transactions to allow you to focus on practical use cases.

The starter is written with TypeScript in React and uses the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) development environment for front-end tooling.

## Features

- Wallet connection with [@daohaus/connect](/sdk/react/connect)
