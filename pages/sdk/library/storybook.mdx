# Storybook

Storybook allows documentation of every component in the UI and stories interoperate between development, testing, and design tools. You can render a specific variation in isolation by passing in props, mocking data, or faking events. Then copy the code into your app.

There are examples of most components in our [Storybook](https://storybook.daohaus.fun/).

Navigate to the component in the left column, change attributes on the Canvas tab, then copy the code from the Docs tab.
