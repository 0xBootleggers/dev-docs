# @daohaus/tx-builder

Tx builder allows your React application to easily make transactions with JavaScript lifecycle functions baked-in to trigger error and success messages, along with other cool features. Transactions are at the core of our platform, so we designed this library to provide helper utilities for this purpose.

The core element is a React Context that bundles together generic transaction calls with subgraph polling within the function. This provides lifecycle methods that we can use to control UI based on synchronized events from within the React component.

The package uses [viem](https://viem.sh/).

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
yarn add @daohaus/tx-builder
```

### Requirements

**Graph API Keys**

If you are trying to query for data on Etheruem Mainnet or Gnosis Chain (and more to come) you will need to provide an API key from Th Graph. Learn to get those key [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/managing-api-keys/) and [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/).

**RPC endpoints**

This package makes transaction to the blockchain so you will also need to provide RPC endpoints for the chains you are targeting.

**Blockchain Explorer API keys**

This package fetches ABIs in some instances if you are not providing the ABI in the txLego. You can provide those keys from [etherscan](https://docs.etherscan.io/) flavored explorers if needed.

### Examples

```tsx
<TXBuilder
  ...
  //all other props
  chainId={'0x1'}
  graphApiKeys={{'0x1': 'some api key'}}
  rpcs={{'0x1': 'some rpc url'}}
  explorerKeys={{'0x1': 'some explorer api key'}}
>
  {children}
</TXBuilder>
```

**How to add to your application**

Tx Builder uses [viem](https://viem.sh/) and requires you to pass a `publicClient` as a prop. This example shows a component wrapped in our DHConnectProvider from the [@daohaus/connect](/sdk/react/connect) package that set up a `publicClient` upon wallet connection.

```tsx
import { TXBuilder } from '@daohaus/tx-builder';

export const SomePage = () => {
  const { publicClient } = useDHConnect();

  return (
    <TXBuilder
      publicClient={publicClient}
      chainId={'0x1'}
      daoId={'0xsomedaoaddress'}
      safeId={'0x0somedaosafeaddress'}
    >
      {children}
    </TXBuilder>
  );
};
```

**Here is a tutorial on how to [build a form](/quickstart/form) and fire a transaction.**

**Here are some examples of [contract and transaction legos](/sdk/react/moloch-v3-legos#examples) used in `tx-builder`.**

**How to fire a transaction**

Tx Builder exposes several handy functions that can be used throughout your app. These can be accessed by importing `useTxBuilder` from Tx Builder:

```tsx
// Anywhere in your app

import { useTxBuilder } from '@daohaus/tx-builder-feature';

...

const { fireTransaction } = useTxBuilder();

...

  fireTransaction({
    tx: ACTION_TX.SOME_TX_LEGO,
    lifeCycleFns:{
      onTxSuccess: () => {
        console.log('do something on success');
      },
    };

```
