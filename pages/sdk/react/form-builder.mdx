# @daohaus/form-builder

DAOhaus apps utilize many forms, and we decided to build a Form Builder tool that can be used to scaffold React forms. Form Builder is designed to take in a form configuration and then leverages existing UI elements and other scaffolding to output a fully functional form component.

This library is highly composable and declarative, and utilizes form elements from our UI library. Form Builder pairs well with [Tx Builder](/sdk/react/tx-builder) to reduce much of the complexity involved in creating forms from scratch. We utilize Form Builder and Tx Builder in our apps where users need to input data for a transaction.

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
yarn add @daohaus/form-builder
```

**How to add to you application**

```tsx
import { FormBuilder } from '@daohaus/form-builder';
import { MolochFields } from '@daohaus/moloch-v3-fields';
import { BASIC_PROPOSAL_FORMS } from '@daohaus/moloch-v3-legos';
import { TARGET_DAO } from '../targetDao';

export const FormPage = () => {
  return (
    <FormBuilder
      form={BASIC_PROPOSAL_FORMS.TRANSFER_ERC20}
      targetNetwork={'0x5'}
      customFields={MolochFields}
    />
  );
};
```

### Examples

Here is a tutorial on how to [build a form](/quickstart/form).

## Components

Form Builder leverages form components from our UI library. It's possible to add _custom components_ to a Form Builder instance, but the default inputs and other elements commonly used in a form (such as title, subtitle, description) utilize DAOhaus component designs.

Since Form Builder is an integrated library, the default input components include our learnings from building forms over the years.

Here are some of the best practices utilized:

Inputs use `forwardRef` so that the reference to the element is maintained (when passing from [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)) to the input.

- User events need these

After getting the input, it's styled with styled-components.

- `input.tsx` with types at the top
- `input.styles`
- `input.stories`

These all go together into the folder for each form element.

These then move into the wrapped input version, which wraps the input with the `FieldWrapper` which pulls in quite a lot from RHF (such as the helper text, required asterisks, etc)

We have a `Buildable` generic that adds the `FieldWrapper` and `PrimitiveWrapper`.

Info prop receives a string and renders a tooltip.

`hasRules` is the validation -- every form lego can accept the rules for validation.

- Receives RHF validation rules, but can also pass in custom values

`CoreFieldLookup` is for the `FormBuilder` and is the factory for all the supported inputs.

- New official DH inputs can be added to the `CoreFieldLookup`
  - This would pull it into `FieldLego` and ensure that the types match the values
  - Data used can only be props of the mapped component, which helps for typing the fields

## Development Guidelines

When building a component, need to consider if its a form element that takes in data and if so you'll want to wrap in the `Buildable`

- Can look at the other wrapped components as examples
  - Get the `useForm` context and registers everything

Since folks may want just the field we create the wrapped and unwrapped versions.

Composing elements example:

`CSInput` wraps `WrappedInput` and watches everything that comes in to this input. It creates helper text and slices things up via the `setValueAs`. This slices up things that are separated by commas and turns them into an array of strings.

- Gets props from the WrappedInput and adds 1 thing

Can keep wrapping and layering in the functionality.

**Can folks overwrite rules if they don't want certain aspects?**

We need consistent behavior, so it's tricky to overwrite -- the higher level rules take precedent so someone could add to the lower level rules or create their own wrapper (such as doing a slash separated input instead of a comma separated one)

Like a pyramid -- higher level up is more specific and opinionated.

`WrappedInput` won't be setting its own rules.
