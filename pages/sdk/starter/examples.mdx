# DAO App Examples

## Invoke

Invoke is an app designed to simplify the process of deploying DAO contracts on the Arbitrum network. Featuring a user-friendly wizard, the app guides users step-by-step through the setup, offering contextual explanations and defaulting certain advanced fields to ensure a safer and more efficient launch process for Moloch v3 DAOs. Upon successful deployment, Invoke provides resources for ongoing administration and support via DAOhaus, as well as customization options through [Bootleggers](https://bootleggers.wtf/), aiming to foster engagement and contribute to the growth of the DAO ecosystem.

## ETH Onboarder

ETH Onboarder is a streamlined app designed to manage the distribution of social or governance tokens through the staking of Ethereum, a chain's native token. The app employs an "onboarding Shaman" to facilitate the process, allowing users to stake into a shared treasury in exchange for DAO tokens. Specifically tailored for the Moloch DAO framework, ETH Onboarder issues tokens as part of its staking rewards.

## Signalling App

The Signalling App, also referred to as a TCR (Token Curated Registry), is an incentivized voting platform designed to generate trusted lists curated and maintained by its users. Harnessing the "Wisdom of the Crowds" approach, users collectively vote with tokens to determine the validity and inclusion of submissions in the list, ensuring higher quality and standards compared to traditional lists. This DAO-managed app empowers DAOs to initiate signal events, permits members to present options, and allows token holders to allocate signals to their preferred choices, demonstrating its versatility in applications ranging from quality control to fraud prevention.

## VC Onboarder

VC Onboarder is a decentralized application (dApp) integrated with a MolochV3 Shaman contract, designed to simplify the onboarding of new members into a DAO. The app enhances security and prevents fraudulent activity by incorporating a sybil-resistant layer, using verifiable credentials for on-chain validation. It adheres to the EIP-712 standard, which governs typed structured data hashing and signing schemes, ensuring a reliable and secure user experience.

## NFT Onboarder

NFT Onboarder enables holders of a specific NFT collection to claim shares in a DAO, bridging the gap between digital collectibles and decentralized governance. Utilizing a custom Shaman, the app registers the NFT collection, meticulously tracks which NFT IDs have been claimed, and mints corresponding shares for the DAO. This seamless integration not only adds utility to the NFTs but also diversifies the ways in which participants can engage with DAOs.
