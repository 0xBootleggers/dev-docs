# PULL REQUEST MANAGEMENT

**WHO**: Any contributor can monitor and test PRs. Ultimately the Protocol Maintenance steward is responsible for ensuring the PR testing and merging process is flowing.

**HOW OFTEN**: Open PRs should be reviewed every other week at minimum.

## HOW TO

**1. Review Open Pull Requests**

Pull Requests can be found in the [monorepo](https://github.com/HausDAO/monorepo/pulls)

All pull requests require approval from an existing contributor before they can be merged. Reach out in [#Protocol Chat](https://discord.com/channels/709210493549674598/1082764707141795960) if you've been contributing for a while and would like to be granted approval permissions.

**2. Pull the branch down locally and test**

Ensure the bug is fixed or feature added works as expected. Smoke test the rest of the app or SDK to ensure this hasn't introduced other issues.

Local development set up can be found on [this page](https://docs.daohaus.club/contributing)

**3. Provide feedback or merge the PR**

Merging to the `develop` branch will build the apps to the testing apps for a final check:

**4. Deploy**

**5. Close the Issue**

Let's keep that issue backlog clean!
