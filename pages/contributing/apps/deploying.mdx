# DEPLOYING APPS AND NPM PACKAGES

**WHO**: Any contributor can monitor and test PRs. Ultimately the Protocol Maintenance steward is responsible for ensuring the PR testing and merging process is flowing.

**HOW OFTEN**: Open PRs should be reviewed every other week at minimum.

## HOW TO

### APPS

The app deployments are managed with github actions, built to Cloudflare instances and the domains are managed by core contributors:

- PRs merged from your feature branch to `develop` will build to the .fun testing deployments
- PRs merged from `develop` to `main` will build to the .club production deployments

The subgraph deployment process can be found [here](/contributing/subgraphs/deploying)

### NPM PACKAGES

The SDK npm packages are managed with github actions and are automatically deployed when package versions are updated and merged into `master`.

**1. Open a release branch**
Create an new branch off `develop` with this naming convention:

`release/<year><month<day>` ie.) `release/20240329`

**2. Bump the npm package versions**
These are found in each affected package in the [libs folder](https://github.com/HausDAO/monorepo/tree/develop/libs)

Use standard semver versioning to identify patch, minor and major version updates.

NOTE: These packages are pretty tightly coupled, so we've been bumping all lib version to keep the version numbers in sync across packages.

**3. Create a Release page**

[All Release](https://github.com/HausDAO/monorepo/releases)

[Example](https://github.com/HausDAO/monorepo/releases/tag/v0.4.1)

Include:

- Full commit log
- Bullet of important changes
- Note any breaking changes and upgrade instructions
- Contributor list

**4. Open a PR**

- First PR from your release branch into `develop`
- Then open one from `develop` into `main`
- PRs will require contributor approval. Post the link to the PR in [#Protocol Chat](https://discord.com/channels/709210493549674598/1082764707141795960) to get help with that.

**5. Monitor the github action log to ensure the build is successful**

**6. Let the world know!**

When deployed post a link to the release page in [#Protocol Chat](https://discord.com/channels/709210493549674598/1082764707141795960)
