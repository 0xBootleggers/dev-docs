# MANAGING STUDIO BILLING ACCOUNT

**WHO**: ASafe signers can view and update billing balances and api keys.

**HOW OFTEN**: Check this monthly and make updates as needed.

**API keys**
You can manage API keys from the studio dashboard at

- https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/
- create new keys
- restrict keys by domain
- view key usage and fees assocaited to it

**Each month** we should check the `dh v3 dev` key to ensure it has not gone over it's alloted usage. This key is not restrained to a domain and if leaked could be missued. If it's over the limit, delete that key and create a new dev key with the same monthly limit.
