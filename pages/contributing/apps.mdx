# Apps Maintenance SOP

This guide will outline the processes for (1) issue triage, (2) pull request review and testing, and (3) app and NPM package deployment.

## Resources

Contribution Guidelines and local development set up can be found on [this page](https://docs.daohaus.club/contributing). These guides assume you are able to run the monorepo locally.

All App and SDK code can be found in the [Monorepo](https://github.com/HausDAO/monorepo)

Here is the [issue board](https://github.com/HausDAO/monorepo/issues)
