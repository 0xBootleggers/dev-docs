# Glossary

## ABI (Application Binary Interface)

An interface that facilitates interaction between two binary program modules. Often, one of these is a library, and the other is a program dynamically linked to the library.

## Contract Address

A unique identifier for a smart contract on the blockchain.

## DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

A type of organization represented by encoded rules, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government.

## Delegation

The act of assigning one's voting power to another member of the DAO.

## Dilution Bound

A predefined limit that determines when a proposal cannot be executed due to a significant number of members ragequitting during the proposal's grace period.

## ENS (Ethereum Name Service)

A decentralized domain name system built on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for human-readable addresses.

## ERC-20 Tokens

A common type of cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum blockchain, following a specific standard for implementation.

## Exit Amount

The total value a DAO member would receive if they decided to exit the DAO.

## Gnosis Safe

A smart contract platform on Ethereum that enables the management of digital assets.

## Grace Period

The set amount of time after voting has ended where those who disagreed with the decision can exit the DAO.

## Guild Kick

A proposal to forcefully remove a member from the DAO, converting their shares into loot and removing their voting power.

## Lens Profile

[Profile NFT](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/profile) in the Lens Protocol.

## Loot

Non-voting tokens held by DAO members that provide a proportional ownership stake in the DAO's treasury.

## Metadata

Data that provides information about other data, in this case the data associated with a DAO and it's members.

## Moloch DAO

Named after the ancient Canaanite god associated with child sacrifice, Moloch DAO is a unique type of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Its structure is intended to encourage members to make sacrifices for the common good, with mechanisms like "Ragequit" allowing dissatisfied members to exit the DAO with their portion of the treasury. It serves as a model for a new type of organizational governance that aims to solve collective action problems among decentralized groups.

## Multicall Proposal

A proposal that consists of multiple actions, allowing for complex changes to be bundled into a single vote.

## Non-Voting Tokens (Loot)

Tokens that provide a proportional ownership stake in the DAO's treasury but do not offer voting rights.

## Proposal

A formal suggestion presented for consideration or decision by the DAO members.

## Proposal Offering

The number of tokens required to be deposited to sponsor a proposal.

## Quorum

The minimum number of members that must participate for a vote to be valid.

## Ragequit

The act of a member burning a certain amount of shares or loot to receive a proportional amount of tokens from the DAO's treasury.

## Rage Kick

A forced version of ragequit, instigated by other members, which burns all of a member's shares and loot, converting them into a proportionate stake in the member's internal balance.

## Safe

A secure storage for the DAO's assets, often referring to a smart contract which securely stores the DAO's funds.

## Shares

Voting power tokens held by DAO members, which grant voting rights and a proportional ownership stake in the DAO's treasury.

## Shaman

A term used to refer to the administrative role in some DAOs, responsible for managing and guiding the DAO's operations.

## Smart Contract

Self-executing contracts where the terms of the agreement are directly written into code, often used in blockchain technologies for automated and decentralized transactions or actions.

## Structural Benevolence

A characteristic of an organizational structure that inherently prevents bias or prejudice against certain members, characteristic of Moloch-style DAOs.

## Summon

The act of creating a new DAO.

## Summoner

The initial member or group of members responsible for creating the DAO.

## Token

A digital representation of a particular asset or utility.

## Treasury

The fund pool that holds the DAO's assets.

## Voting Period

The set amount of time that members have to vote on a proposal.

## Voting Tokens (Shares)

Tokens that confer voting rights and a proportional ownership stake in the DAO's treasury.

## WalletConnect

An open-source protocol for connecting decentralized applications to mobile wallets, allowing for secure interactions between the two.
